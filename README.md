# Python Project Template

_A template for python projects_


## Goals
* make it easier (less boring) to maintain multiple, small packages, and
* document what I learn about how to set up a python project.
To test and demonstrate the from which it is generated.


## Non-goals
* Support multiple, competing tools. 
  This project wants to remove the burden of evaluating tools by providing a set that works and works together. 


## ToDo
* Infer `short_name` from `long_name`: basically normalize it?
* Validate `short_name`: this should be a valid (normal?) package name?
* Allow choice of `main` or `master` as primary branch for new projects?
* Allow choice of supported python versions?
* Docs?
  * Style guide
* Allow (multiple) choice of (lib? and) bin
*
